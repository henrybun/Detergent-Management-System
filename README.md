The “EIE Microcontroller Application Design Contest (2020 – 21)” is organized by the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and sponsored by RS Components Ltd. The contest aims to promote EIE students’ interest in microcontroller-based electronic product design and to provide a platform for EIE students to exercise their creativity and innovation through teamwork.

The contest consists of two phases. In Phase I, each team with at most three members was required to submit a proposal to describe the design and implementation of its products. Before the deadline (i.e., 8 December 2020), RS Components Ltd. and the EIE department organized a brainstorming session on 7 December 2020 for all students to share their ideas and gave them comments. Phase I was completed on 8 December 2020 with some proposals received. Seven teams were shortlisted for Phase II. In Phase II, shortlisted teams received financial support and technical advice/support from the EIE Department and RS Components Ltd. All teams had around two months to produce their products based on their proposals.

On 8 February 2021, each team delivered a 15-minute presentation to describe and demonstrated the features of its final product with a 5-minute Q & A session right after. A panel of judges was formed by the EIE Department (two representatives) and a representative from RS Components Ltd.

## Introduction

Hong Kong is a busy city and everyone here is busy in living. People may not aware that their detergents are running out and it may be too late when they find it out. This project is to develop a detergent management system to help people solving this problem.

The idea is simple: We use force sensing resistors (FSRs) to measure the weight of detergents and the readings are received by an Arduino MKR1000 microcotnroller. The microcontroller sends the readings to a server and the server updates the information in a mobile app and post notifications if any.

This application can be used in hotels and lodges to provide a better room service with less manpower. Detergents will be reloaded just before they are running out. It can also be used for someone living alone. It provides a better house management. Moreover, it can also be applied for toilets in malls, plazas and public area for monitoring and refilling detergents.

Comment from judges: The team builds a complete system for demonstration and it is good to have the circuit built on a PCB, especially they are Year 2 students only. The system can get a better result if they can use different calibration methods to make a more accurate measurement.
